# latex-test

for next documentation you might want to use git(hub) to make PDF from LaTex... after some fighting against github actions and crappy documentation where I had to guess what to do, it was possible to generate a PDF in a github actions job.. so that a writer can have a git commit history of the changes to the LaTex file and it generates a PDF in the artifacts directory of github actions https://github.com/montao/latex-test/actions/runs/113645682
